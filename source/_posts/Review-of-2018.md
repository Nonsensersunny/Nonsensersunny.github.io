One could get indulged in the memory, but may he not in the past. 2018 means a lot to many people especially those the same generation as me. For me, the past year mixed with confusion, helplessness, as well as euphoria, yet never did despair. To make a brief overview of the past facilitates one’s determination of the forthcoming new year and that’s exactly I’m doing now.<!--more-->

> #### Year of obsession

Since the day I decided to take the Master’s Entrance Examination, seldom did I have time coming back home to have a relatively long stay with my parents. Sentimental as I am, I tend to get depressed seeing them aging year by year. Every time when it occurs to me that I’ll have much less time accompanying them, sorrow stuffs with me. Nearly one fourth of my life passed, but how much time left for them and how much time can I get to be with them. The day I finished the last subject of the exam, the only thing in my mind was not the outcome but the willingness to get back home with my parents and to tell them I miss them so much. However, there’s still long way to go and never should I get stuck in the futile eagerness. As time goes by, the only thing I can do is to keep moving on and bear the obsession in my mind. I’ll never win in the race with time, but I can speed up to make the day back home earlier to come.

> #### Year of resolution

It was not until I saw hard preparation of the others for the Master’s Entrance Examination that I took my determination seriously. I used to have strong faith in myself and things would always gonna be fine as it happens. But things tend not to be what you imagined it to be just with your will power. It is not the resolute but the action that really matters. I’ve long been aware that I’m not the kind of people take plans into practice. Once upon a time, one of my classmates in the Senior High School delivered a speech and the very sentence expressed me so much and it went like this, dream not being necessity but catalyst for human while the way pursuing it counts.

> #### Year of hesitation

Just like the protagonist, 김정환, in the hit and my favorite Korean episode, Reply 1988, in which he eventually realized that it was not the myriad barricades that prevented him from chasing his own happiness but chosen to compromise again and again and the defeat in his character that held him back, that is hesitation actually, I think I’m a little bit like him. Opportunities lapsed as I hesitated to take it or not. Men are born to make choices but seldom do they get the essence of making proper choices and unfortunately I am one of them feeling at sea at the crossroads. I used to roll the dice.

> #### Year of confusion

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness. As the famous entrepreneur, Lei Jun, once said that one who leads the trend may seize the age. The explosive advancement of technology today is both a challenge and chance for us. But within the vastly paced age, one can hardly stand steadfast to follow his own way to make progress since there’s been stuffing with more and more tempts and deviations. Inquisitive as I am, I also get confused by the massive resources. Enthusiastic pursuit for advanced technique fails to facilitate the basic understanding of it but waggles the existing knowledge.

> People may find my not being optimistic as I was before. Indeed, adverse stiffens one’s determination. But I have to reiterate that I’m not totally in despair but alter my perspective in thinking about things and the world. Avoiding to make blueprint for the future doesn’t mean that I give up making efforts to achieve my goals; wavering before making decisions doesn’t mean that I fear to make a difference to get things better; getting confused within the era of technology doesn’t mean that I’m defeated by massive pressure. I still have faith in myself and I’ll hold on tightly to my dreams. The future can be anticipated, I firmly argue.
